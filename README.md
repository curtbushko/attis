# NAME ORIGINS

`God of vegetation whose ever-repeating cycle of self-consumption, death and resurrection represented a cycle of the fruits of the earth.`<BR>

These days, all cloud tools seem to be using Greek naming patterns. Kubernetes, Prometheus and Istio are prime examples. I find it to be kind of fun. This tools deals with Google Cloud and Terraform so finding a Greek Earth God seemed to fit will. Even better is finding a name that has to do with the cycle of re-creating the earth. This is kind of what you do when you deal with configuration managment.<BR>
